Description: Identifying important factors from a large number of potentially important factors of a highly nonlinear and computationally expensive black box model is a difficult problem. Xiao, Joseph, and Ray (2022) <doi:10.1080/00401706.2022.2141897> proposed Maximum One-Factor-at-a-Time (MOFAT) designs for doing this. A MOFAT design can be viewed as an improvement to the random one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) design proposed by Morris (1991) <doi:10.1080/00401706.1991.10484804>. The improvement is achieved by exploiting the connection between Morris screening designs and Monte Carlo-based Sobol' designs, and optimizing the design using a space-filling criterion.
